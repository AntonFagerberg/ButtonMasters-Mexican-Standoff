ButtonMaster's Mexican Standoff
===============================

A simple game hacked together during one day in Java using LibGDX. The "art" was made by me and the music used in the
intro is from http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/282154. I used some additional music when developing the game
but I have not included it here because of copyright reasons.

### Controls
Player 1: Q & A

Player 2: G & H

Player 3: P & L

There is also support for Xbox 360 controllers where A, B & X is used (the buttons position corresponds to the players
position on the screen).
